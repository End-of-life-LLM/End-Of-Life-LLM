This book offers a comparative analysis summarising the results of the research and exploring the impact of social media on politics and gender, education and commerce. What is the result of the increased emphasis on visual communication? Are we becoming more individual or more social? Why is public social media so conservative? Why does equality online fail to shift inequality offline? How did memes become the moral police of the internet? Supported by an introduction to the project’s academic framework and theoretical terms that help to account for the findings, the book argues that the only way to appreciate and understand something as intimate and ubiquitous as social media is to be immersed in the lives of the people who post. Only then can we discover how people all around the world have already transformed social media in such unexpected ways and assess the consequences.URIhttp://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/32834Keywordssocial media; society; memes; Anthropology; China; Facebook; Field researchDOI10.14324/111.9781910634493ISBN9781910634479, 9781910634486, 9781910634516, 9781910634523, 9781910634493OCN944252219PublisherUCL PressPublisher websitehttps://www.uclpress.co.uk/Publication date and place2016GrantorFP7 Ideas: European Research Council - 295486 - SOCNET - FP7Research grant informationFind all documentsSeriesWhy We Post,ClassificationSociety and Social SciencesSocial and cultural anthropologyPages286Public remarkRelevant Wikipedia pages: Anthropology - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology; China - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China; Facebook - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook; Field research - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_research; Social media - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mediaRightshttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/Imported or submitted locallySearch OAPENThis CollectionBrowseAll of OAPENSubjectsPublishersLanguagesCollectionsMy AccountLoginRegisterExportRepository metadataExport search resultsThe export option will allow you to export the current search results of the entered query to a file.
