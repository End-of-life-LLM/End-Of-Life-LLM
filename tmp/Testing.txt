A stressed person may, for instance, engage in social support seeking as a coping strategy, using social media as the coping tool. The coping effectiveness depends on the goodness of fit of the chosen combination to the stressful circumstances resulting in beneficial or detrimental short-term (e.g., stress) and long-term effects (e.g., life satisfaction) [9,10]. When an individual cannot control situational circumstances, for instance, distracting oneself may be a good strategy to calm stress-induced negative emotions whereas such self-distraction is a poor coping strategy when one can easily alter the situation, for instance, through better planning [11].
The functions of social media in the stress-coping process
Social media have three functions in the seesaw of demands and resources. Two concern the first appraisal process, and one concerns the second appraisal process (see Figure 1). In the next sections, we will outline these three functions and the respective state of research on them.
Social media as stressors
Due to the set of features they provide to their users, social media can function as stressors [12,13], an assumption we name the social-media-use-causes-stress-hypothesis. First, social media can trigger approval anxiety. They offer many options for an (idealized) self-presentation, such as editing photos and updates [13,14]. The photos and updates can usually be viewed by a large and diverse audience (e.g., friends, family, colleagues) [15], which may create uncertainty about others' reactions to one's social media appearance [15]. Especially for adolescents [16], the pressure to appear attractive and popular on social media is high [17] and can result in stress. Stress due to approval anxiety may further increase because the number of received likes makes it easy to judge one's popularity [18].
Second, social media can trigger fear of missing out (FoMO), the fear “that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent” (p. 1841) [19]. Even though people also experience FoMO offline, on social media, friends' activities are directly pushed into one's news feed. Additionally, people tend to share mainly the positive moments in their lives [20, 21, 22]. Thus, social media users can easily gain the impression that their friends have more rewarding experiences. Several studies found direct or indirect positive relationships between FoMO and stress [4,23]. A reduction in FoMO might also explain why some studies, in which participants were asked to abstain from social media for a few days found a stress decrease [24,25].
Social media can trigger stress in several other ways. More recently, work has identified exposure to (mis)information about COVID-19 as an additional stressor [26,27]. This misinformation refers to threatening information (e.g., increasing numbers of cases or deaths, also among social media friends), misinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories. Other stressors include availability stress (the demand to be permanently available), connection overload (the perception of not being able to process all information), or online vigilance (the cognitive salience of the online world) [28,29]. The latter three stressors can be provoked by social media notifications, but also by push notifications from news apps or work emails. These stressors are, thus, rather due to the fact that social media are frequently accessed via mobile media (vs. desktop computers) and should not be equated with stressors stemming mostly from the social media's characteristics (e.g., positivity norm, visibility of posts to a large audience).
In summary, studies show that social media can trigger stressors. These stressors can shift the (im)balance between stressors and resources in the direction of stressors (see Figure 1) and increase stress. However, social media can also weigh down the other side of the seesaw – as resources.
Social media as resources
Social media can provide resources that buffer stress. We name this assumption the social-media-use-buffers-stress-hypothesis. This function of social media could occur during the first appraisal process and causes a shift in the balance between resources and stressors, which as a result, prevents or mitigates stress.
Social media may help to build and maintain social capital and thus provide access to resources [30,31]. Social capital stems from the networks people maintain; like money, it forms a resource that can be used when needed [32]. Even without using it, knowing that one has social capital, can function as a stress buffer [33]. Qualitative studies suggest that such a stress-buffering effect can occur when people face stigma in their offline lives, such as when they belong to a stigmatized sexual minority group [34,35]. Through social media, stigmatized individuals are able to find similar others and role models who provide support and guidance. Individuals can remember this guidance when they face a potentially stressful situation [34,35]. There is some experimental evidence supporting the stress-buffering function [36∗∗, 37, 38∗]: In an experiment, Rus and Tiesmensma [36] found, for example, that using social media (vs. reading online magazines) before being confronted with a stressor led to lower stress levels in the following stress induction implying that being reminded of social media resources (e.g., social capital) buffers stress.
Social media as coping tools
Aside from the fact that they can shift the balance between resources and stressors and thus mitigate or amplify stress evocation, social media can also be used as coping tools after stress has been evoked. This represents the third function of social media in the stress-coping process. In what follows, we will first outline the evidence for the use of social media as coping tools and then review the state of research on the effectiveness of social media use for coping with stress.
The use of social media as coping tools
In the second appraisal of the stress-coping process, people typically evaluate the available coping options. It is imaginable that social media are chosen as coping tools, a process that we call the stress-triggers-social-media-use-hypothesis. There is ample evidence that stress triggers social media use in general [39,40], but also more specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic [41, 42, 43]. Social media can be used for three main coping strategies. First, several studies show that stress triggers social support seeking on social media [44, 45]. Second, people can also use social media to improve stress-induced negative emotions (emotion-focused coping, [8]): Social media were in particular used for distracting oneself from a stressful encounter [46,47] and for venting emotions [48]. Thirdly, social media were used to solve the stress-evoking problem (problem-focused coping) [40,49,50].
The effectiveness of social media as coping tools
When social media are used for coping, the question arises if this use effectively reduces stress. According to Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model of stress and coping [8], the effectiveness of social media use depends on how well this use and the chosen coping strategy fits situational circumstances. For instance, using social media to seek support from a large audience could be effective if a solution for a rare problem must be found while such social support seeking might be less effective in situations in which only sensitive emotional support can mitigate feelings of stress. We have termed this assumption of situational fit effectiveness-of-coping-with-social-media-depends-on-fit-hypothesis. Unfortunately, the fit between coping strategies and circumstances is barely investigated. Most studies only look at the cross-situational effectiveness of coping using social media and investigate person–level correlations between stress and social media use. This has led to inconsistent findings for the three coping strategies for which social media can be used (social support, emotion-focused coping, problem-focused coping).
First, longitudinal studies have found mixed effects concerning the effectiveness of social media use for social support [5,51, 52∗∗, 53]. Overall, the effectiveness of social support received through social media was rather demonstrated by studies using shorter timeframes (i.e., days, weeks) [5,52] than studies using longer timeframes [51,53] (i.e., months). Second, results for social media use for self-distraction as a form of emotion-focused coping were also mixed. Distracting oneself from stress by using social media was found to be effective in qualitative studies [46,47] and one experience sampling study [52], but ineffective in another [54]. Third, for problem-focused coping, qualitative studies support the stress-relieving function of using topic-centered social media groups [49,55, 56, 57]. A survey conducted during the pandemic [58] found a negative relationship between social media use for informational search, a form of problem-focused coping, and stress levels, indicating successful coping. However, misleading information or negative and inappropriate responses were described to lead to ineffective coping [57].
Challenges for future research
For each of the three functions social media can have in the stress-coping process (as a source of stress, as a resource to buffer stress, and as a means to cope with stress, see Figure 1), theoretical and methodological challenges remain. The biggest challenge for research on the first function (social-media-use-causes-stress-hypothesis) is that work on stress triggered by social media use often confounds stress coming from the use of social media and stress coming from mobile media use in general. Here, further conceptual and methodological work is necessary to disentangle stress evoked by a high frequency of notifications from stress stemming from the specific set of features provided by social media.
Research on the second function (social-media-use-buffers-stress-hypothesis), has received limited attention, and effects of social media use on stress have often been confounded with social media as coping tools. A challenge for future research is to distinguish processes from the first and second appraisal, which can be done by determining the timing of social media use (before vs. after the stress evocation).
Research on the third function (stress-triggers-social-media-use-hypothesis, effectiveness-of-coping-with-social-media-depends-on fit-hypothesis) has benefited from the emergence of longitudinal and experience sampling studies [5,51, 52∗∗, 53, 54]. However, situational circumstances have rarely been assessed so that research has only tested cross-situational relationships and not the fit of coping using social media to a situation. Looking at situational characteristics such as the controllability of situations is a promising avenue for future research. This affords to identify stressful situations and measure associated coping behaviors that could take place at different time intervals from the stress-triggering situation [59]. Using continuous physiological stress measurements from devices as fitness trackers might open new possibilities to study dynamic stress responses.
Finally, a methodological problem that concerns all three social media functions in the stress-coping process is that most studies have only focused on the amount of social media use, whereas the content seen or posted on social media as well as the communication partners are rarely considered. Likely, different social media content (e.g., positive or negative) and different social media communication partners (e.g., family or strangers) lead to varying effects on stress levels. Therefore, measuring social media content and communication partners, and connecting these data with subjective or objective stress indicators might be one of the most valuable avenues for future research.
Conclusion
To conclude, social media can have three functions in the stages of the stress-coping process. They can serve as stressors, resources, or coping tools. Research has yet to determine under what circumstances social media serve rather as resources or as stressors and rather as an effective or ineffective coping tool. More fine-grained research designs that consider the timing of social media use, the situational context, the coping strategies for which social media are used, the communication partners, and the encountered content are needed. We believe that conducting research from a functional perspective allows us to give differentiated advice on how to design and use social media in a way that helps to prevent and reduce stress.
